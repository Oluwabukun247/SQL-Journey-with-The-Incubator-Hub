Hands-on SQL projects and exercises demonstrating my understanding of database management, data analysis, and query optimization.

*SQL Learning Journey: Unlocking Insights with SQL ðŸš€*

As I continue my data analysis journey with The Incubator Hub, I'm excited to share my recent learnings in SQL. This journey has deepened my understanding of extracting valuable insights from data to inform business decisions.

*Why SQL?*

You might wonder, isn't Excel perfect for data analysis and visualization? While Excel is powerful, it has limitations. As a data analyst, I've learned that SQL is essential for working with large datasets directly from databases. When dealing with millions of data points, Excel's limitations become apparent â€“ it's restricted to 1,048,576 rows per sheet. Imagine analyzing 3,000,000 sales transactions; you'd need multiple sheets and manual maintenance. SQL eliminates this hassle, allowing me to access and manipulate databases with ease.

*Hereâ€™s What I Learnt*

- Mastering `UNION` and `UNION ALL` to combine data from multiple sources

- Applying conditional logic with `CASE WHEN` statements to update columns and categorize data

- Automating aggregations like sums, counts, minimums, and maximums â€“ tasks that would normally require manual effort in Excel pivot tables

- Utilizing SQL clauses (`WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`) to filter and analyze data

- Understanding database backup and restore processes

*The Impact of SQL*

SQL has the potential to transform businesses by:

- Informing decision-making with data-driven insights

- Optimizing operations and improving efficiency

- Enhancing data accuracy and reliability

I'm grateful to Digital SkillUp Africa for the opportunity to learn and grow with The Incubator Hub. ðŸ“ˆ
